# The Cat and the Couch
Once upon a time, on the couch that was oriented south in the north-east of the industrial district of an unnamed town in Edimburgh, sat a cat.
There was nothing specific about this cat; it was just a cat like you could find anywhere, with dark lines covering its white and grey fur.
However, what *was* specific about this cat was that it was sitting on this couch. There was no other cat around; it was alone.
